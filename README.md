# OV7670 Camera interface with Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA

This project is a work in progress and involves interfacing OV7670 camera module to Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA board (Qmtech Wukong Board). The output camera frame is displayed on a VGA monitor. SDRAM is used as a frame buffer to buffer the data and transmit it over VGA.
